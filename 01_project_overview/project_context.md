## Seller Acquisition & Marketing Funnel Performance (B2B Growth)

This project analyzes the seller acquisition side of Olist’s marketplace, focusing on how marketing leads progress through the funnel from initial contact to closed deals and revenue generation.

The objective is to understand funnel efficiency, identify drop-offs, and evaluate whether acquisition efforts prioritize seller quality in addition to volume.

Together with a complementary e-commerce growth project focused on buyers, this analysis provides a complete marketplace perspective.
